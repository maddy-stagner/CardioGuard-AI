# CardioGuard-AI
Highlights the cardiovascular focus (vital signs monitoring)
Project Overview
WearSenseAI is a digital health technology project built to support low-cost, real-time remote patient monitoring using physiological data collected via wearable sensors. The system classifies abnormal vital signs using a machine learning model and provides intelligent alerts to caregivers. It’s designed especially for use in low-resource clinical and home-care settings, with a focus on equity and accessibility in healthcare.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Real-World Dataset: Uses authentic human vital signs data from wearable sensors

🤖 ML-Based Abnormality Detection: Trained Random Forest classifier on SpO₂, Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, and Temperature

📊 Live Vital Signs Simulation: Simulates incoming data streams for real-time risk detection

⚠️ Smart Alert System: Notifies when patient vitals exceed safe thresholds

💡 Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated SHAP visualizations to explain each prediction

📈 Interactive Dashboard: Real-time health monitor built with Streamlit

🌍 Low-Cost & Equitable: Designed for deployment in resource-limited settings
